# ProximityGamePlayer
Proximity game player created using python for Advanced Programming Class
Strategy Game (https://www.mathsisfun.com/games/proximity.html). 
There is one board of hexagons and two players, red and blue. In each round the player receives a random number, 
e.g. x, from 1 to 20 and places it in a free cell dashboard. If this cell is a neighbor with cells:
(i) of the same suit, increases their value by 1.
(ii) of the other suit, occupies them (i.e. changes color) if their value is less than x. 
The game ends when there are no free cells left on the board. The player who has the most points wins
